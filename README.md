This repository is from a course teaching how to host websites on GitHub and nothing more =D



The steps to host your website are simple:
-
1) First create a repository with your GitHub's username plus github.io (ex. in my case: rodriguesgiancarlo.github.io).

2) Commit your website's structure to the repository.

3) Create a file named CNAME and put your domain inside it.

4) It's done. Just type the name of the repository in browser and check it!
